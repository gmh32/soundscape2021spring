This is an in class reflective writing exercise from Thursday 2/4/21

Write about the soundscape narrative in progress: What's exciting about it? What's challening about it? What are you unsure of?

I am excited to start to bring to life this idea of mine about the long drive home to surprise family.  Given that I was able to
actually do this about year ago, and how life has changed SO much since then, I am very excited to recrate this feeling that I was
able to experience through the long travel home and the excitement of just making my family happy.  As a fairly visual person, I am
both excited and slightly nervous to use only sounds throughout this project. If my point is not coming across by the use of sounds,
there is not a visual aid that could provide further explanation, just altering the sole media available for a soundscape - sound. 
I think this will be a challenge but will be a fun one.

What seems to make a soundscape narrative work? especially with regard to teh blog posts on listening to soundscapes we have looked at
From the blog posts, I am noticing many people praise the use of space and volume adjustments to create distance or spatiality.
Also, many poeple commented highly about the use of repetition.
