Idea to base the project around: going home for a weekend surprise from school
– finishing up school on friday afternoon,  hearing the last zoom class teacher and students say “alright have a good weekend see you monday" and all the student thank you's
- closing the laptop
- packing up my backpack
- packing clothes and the like in a suitcase
- putting everything in the car
- warming it up because it is very cold
- breathing onto hands and rubbing them together
- turning the heat up
- hearing the motor and car start moving out of its parked state
- sound of crosswalks throughout oakland and pittsburgh
- sound of directions on phone saying “256 miles straight” etc
- happy sigh
- turning on some music, humming along with it, skipping songs around
- getting bored, turning on an audio book
- stopping at rest stop for gas and grabbing a drink and food (sound of turn signal, engine slowing down, car keys taken out, founds of gas filling up, sounds of door opening, food wrapper, drink order, etc)
- car door close, turn signal and engine sounds of getting on the road again
- more music, getting bored of the music, calling mari and telling her how far I am
- her saying they just called her and me asking if mom and dad have any suspicion, her of course saying no
- the sound of the car motor running for most of the entire soundscape, 
- getting home: taking the keys out of the car, big stretch, siri “traveled time 5 hours” etc,
- walking up to front door
- putting keys in the door
- opening it and saying “hey, whats for dinner” or something casual
- mom’s “awww!! o my gosh!” her voice coming from far away and then closer
- dad comes along too aw how you been
- then simulating as in a hug with mom and her talking right next to my ear kinda muffled from the hug, a happy sigh of the sense of being home
- the end


Need to record:
- teacher figure:
	- "Alright everyone that's it for class today, see you Monday!"
	- all the thanks you's are from online free-sound
	- me: "Thank you"
	- teacher says after a few thanks "have a good weekend"
- me:
	- (as noted above) a "thank you" during the zoom call ending
	- maybe an exhale "hmm okay" after closing the laptop sound, then packing noises
- sister:
	- hey, (you) hey, I just got off the phone with mom, she said she and dad are still at work.
	- Awesome did they seem like they suspected anything?
	- (you) no they still have no idea you're driving up for the weekend.  What's your eta?
	- 4 hours to go
	- (you) not too bad
	- yea not bad, I'll text you when I get there
	- (you) cool drive safe 
	- thanks see you on Monday


Keep straight on I 76 east for 246 miles
